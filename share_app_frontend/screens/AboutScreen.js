        SHARE is an innovative borrowing and lending application meticulously
        crafted by third-year Software Engineering students at Lancaster
        University Leipzig. Our project is driven by the mission to provide a
        sophisticated communal borrowing and exchange solution, enabling
        individuals within a specific community to seamlessly borrow and lend
        items, and to foster a sense of community, where individuals can
        connect, share resources, and contribute to a more sustainable and
        interconnected way of living. Join us in creating a positive impact by
        embracing the S.H.A.R.E. lifestyle..

        space, and other constraints. SHARE stands as a technological and
        communal solution, offering a platform to foster community connections
        and resource accessibility.
